  The industrial and technological development of any nation depends to a large extent on the level of scientific education of her citizens. The central purpose of science learning is conceptualized as developing scientific literacy in students (Dani 2009). The role of science in the development of any nation cannot be overemphasized since the level of scientific attainment of a nation has always been a very important index for measuring its level of development. This, in turn, determined the country's level of socio-economic as well as industrial development. One of the major subject areas necessary for such advancement is biology.
  Biology is a branch of science structured to equip students with the knowledge of relevant concepts and scientific skills (Onyegegbu, 2002). It also aimed at developing broadly applicable skills such as problem-solving, communication, critical thinking and objective reasoning abilities to enable students to prepare for the workplace a self-sustainability in the world economy (Federal Ministry of Education FME, 2008). With this objective of the curriculum, students are expected to be useful and productive members of society. In order to achieve these objectives of biology, the teaching approach should promote students to assume responsibility and control over their acquisition of knowledge and skills. 
  Self-regulated learning strategy is an active constructive process whereby learners set goals for their learning and attempt to monitor, regulate and control their cognition, motivation and contextual features in an environment (Tang 2012). 
  Perhaps, the lecture method of teaching commonly used by most biology teachers does not offer the students the opportunity for active participation and does not promote meaningful learning of biology concepts. It is hoped that making students take responsibility for their own learning through a self-regulated learning strategy may enhance students' academic achievement in Biology.
  In Nigerian senior secondary schools, science, whatever form it assumes, is taught through such subjects as Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Agricultural Science, Animal Husbandry, Geography, Computer science, Economics, Health Science and Biology. 
  Biology is a natural science which studies the existence (evolution, morphology and physiology) of living things, as well as their interactions with non-living components of the earth. Simply described, Biology is the study of life and living organism. Knowledge of Biology prepares students to undertake further studies and eventually build careers in such scientific fields as medical sciences and allied fields, pharmaceutical sciences, Environmental Biology, Biotechnology, plant and animal sciences/husbandry, agricultural sciences, food sciences, among others. Nigerian students recognise this importance, hence it being the most subscribed science subjects in Nigerian secondary schools, the with 1, 087, 884 candidates in 2018, as against 728, 998 for Chemistry, 704, 504 for Physics and 495, 920 for Agricultural science (Khalil 2011.)
